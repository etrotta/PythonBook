good luck thinking about the Concept explanation and good examples, future-self

- explain what immutability is
- explain what mutability is
- show an example with `+= list` vs `+= number` for multiple variables referring to the same thing?
- mention which built-in types are mutable or immutable
- briefly comment on frozenset
- See Also: Hashes
- To be determined: Mention that only immutable objects should be hashable inside of which of them... `[!note]-` on both?
- mutable default arguments
