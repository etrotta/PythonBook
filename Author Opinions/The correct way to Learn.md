For the my purposes, we'll divide methods of studying in two ways:
- Bottom-up: Start by learning the theorical fundamentals about why something works, then escalate into more practical use cases
- Top-down: Start by learning about practical use cases and the concepts behind them, then dive deeper into how things work until you reach the fundamentals

Both are valid ways depending on what you are learning, and are not completely exclusive.
You may want to see some example use cases while learning about the foundations to get a notion of why they could be useful, and you may want to understand in detail how some concepts work as you build an understanding of them.

For some topics like math, you'll typically need to learn bottom up, understanding all of the foundations before using them in practical problems, but for other topics such as natural languages you'll first learn how to use it, and only then start studying how it works in depth.

Programming and programming languages fall in between that. Algorithms, data structures and other more technical parts do require a bottom-up understanding about how computers work, but programming languages themselves can be learned in a top-down way, first understanding how to use instruct computers with simple statements then learning about more complex instructions and what's going on behind the scenes.

> You do not even need to use a programming language to program, the languages just let you write high-level instructions in a way computers can interpret them.
> You could 'program' by writing a set of instructions for a human to follow in English or writing algorithms in pseudo-code.
> Visual tools and games like Scratch, Blockly and Lightbot have you program without using an actual programming language.

> This book teaches you how to use the Python programming language. You learn how to program (on your own) as a side effect of that, as you solve problems that require for you to think like a programmer.
> If you want to Learn to Program, as in Leetcode style competitive programming abilities, you must study the foundations, which are rarely covered by high level languages and resources teaching about them such as this book.

If you were learning with a focus on more technical aspects, you may want to start with a language with a lower level of abstraction such as C or Rust, and start with the foundations of how things work before using them in practice.

If you are learning with a focus on more practical aspects, you're in the right place with a language with a higher level of abstraction such as Python, as that gives you a more familiar set of operations you can use to instruct the computer.

%% surely there is a way of writing this using fewer "with"s?.. %%

As you should have guessed by now, this book takes a top-down approach, with a focus on practical problems. In each chapter, you'll first see a brief example of how a concept is used in practice, be presented all of the things you can do with it, then work on a real problem to practice.

To reinforce this point: You are not supposed to memorize "all things", but rather come back to the Reference whenever you are looking for the operation required to instruct the computer to do a certain thing, both while solving the associated exercise as well as during future exercises and projects.
