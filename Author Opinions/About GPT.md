About using Large Language Models as assistants for programming, or even worse, trying to delegate the entire process to them.
Applies to all models, including ChatGPT, Gemini and CodeLlama.


Let's be real, we have all heard about how GPT and friends are going to kill programming as a job and you might have some friends telling you that you're wasting your time reading this book.
Are they right? Obviously I'd say no - I wouldn't have wasted my time writing this book either if GPT could make it redundant in the near future.
However, there might still be some place for them.

GPT could automate some *parts* of it, like it can help automate many parts of many jobs, but there are extremely few jobs it can outright eliminate, it just changes which aspects are the most important for humans to focus on.
For programming, it can help automate writing code, or more precisely, converting algorithms into code. It is much less useful in other aspects such as planning the algorithm in first place, given it's limited context and outdated knowledge.

If you know what you want to achieve, GPT can help you get there faster, but for it to be useful you have to understand both what you do need, as well as which pitfalls you ought to avoid, having a clear vision of what an ideal result would look like.

When it comes to programming, this means understanding all of the types of data GPT will need to work with, having a good understanding of the operations it has to perform on them, as well as being able to verify it'll work as expected by comparing the generated code with other resources such as the official documentation for the tools being used.

In summary, GPT and friends could make a good programmer more efficient, but they cannot suddenly turn a normal person into a programmer out of nowhere. 

This book is not focused around using GPT whatsoever, and I personally would not even recommend using them as of mid 2024, but the skills this book you'll obtain as you progress through the book and practice solving problems should remain relevant for the foreseeable future.
