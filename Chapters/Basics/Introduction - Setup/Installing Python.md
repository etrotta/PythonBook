The first thing you have to do is install the Python Interpreter. You can find the official download links in https://python.org. 

> [!info]- Different Python versions
> There are multiple Python implementations, each with multiple different versions.
> This book will only cover the implementation you can download from python.org, also called "CPython". It is the standard Python implementation and is written in the C programming language. The most recent version as of this book being written is 3.12, but it should be relevant for all future 3.x versions.
> Do not use Python 2.x versions such as 2.7, they have been declared dead since 2020 and were already supposed to be dead long before that.
> There are some other notable implementations such as `pypy`, `jython`, `IronPython` and `Meta's Cinder`, but you do not have to worry about them, and this book does not covers nor supports them.

I strongly recommend installing an Integrated Development Environment as well, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). It is possible to follow along using a different IDE, but many of this book's Chapters and Extra pages will assume that you are using it.
You may want to customize your Theme, modify your Hotkeys or install other Extensions, but be careful not to install too many Extensions you do not need. See the [[Extra/Ecosystem/Tooling/VSCode Extensions|VSCode Extensions]] Extra page for more information.

You can continue to [[Chapters/Basics/Introduction - Setup/Hello World|Hello World]] in order to write your first program and learn how to run Python code, or take some more time to setup a [[Extra/Ecosystem/Dependencies/Virtual Environments|Virtual Environment]] if you want to keep everything extremely well organized from the start.
