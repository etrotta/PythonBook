# Reader Experience

### What to expect
%% Name idea: Practical Python? Erm seems like it's already in use by someone else, not really surprised %%
%% for now, if I need of a name besides 'Python Book': "Python in Wan Place", maybe "Python in one piece" %%

This book focuses on practical usages of Python, teaching you only the minimum details you'll require about each topic then guiding you to learn more about them as you need of it instead of teaching you everything in order.

This book does not teaches you many programming fundamentals you would need for a traditional job, such as algorithms and data structures. It focuses on knowledge you can directly apply to your own problems, showing when you would use each tool available to you, and most importantly, building up the know-how to find relevant information when solving problems.

From the middle of the book onwards, you'll pick one [[Projects/Basic/Introduction to Projects|guided project]] to follow, and by the time you finish it you should have enough experience to start your own personal projects.

Many decisions were made so that you may practice breaking a problem down into parts, as well as better understand how your solution will fit within its context, as opposed to only being able to solve problems when they are already broken into parts for you.

### Tradeoffs

Being written making full use of Obsidian's Graph-like features, unlike a traditional book you are not supposed to fully read each section before moving to the next. Such 'optional sections' are much closer to the documentation of real projects you'll have to navigate later, and do make things more confusing for readers not used to this format.

Many of the book's design decisions differs from traditional popular resources with a more rigid structure, more focused exercises and that leave less room for mistakes.

While many may prefer their approach, I choose to leave much more room for you to make mistakes and learn from them, forcing you to identify what you need and search for it (albeit within the book) in each exercise, as will have to for real problems in the future.

Expect for the examples and exercises to be more complicated than those you may see elsewhere, and get used to seeking information a few links away instead of being told what to use in each place.

### How to get the most out of this book

I recommend downloading the book and opening it in Obsidian, but you can use whichever editor you prefer as long as it can display markdown properly and follow the links. You shouldn't treat this book as a 'read-only' resource, but rather edit it yourself as you follow along, writing your own notes, creating your own highlights and saving other useful pieces of information such as external resources you use.

If you get stuck and cannot figure out how to proceed with the information from the book, first take a break and try again, but if that still doesn't works do not hesitate to look up external resources, including but not limited to the [official documentation](https://www.python.org/), tutorial sites like [https://realpython.com/], QA sites like Stack Overflow or even active communities in other platforms such as Discord. 

You should also practice what you learn beyond the proposed Exercises, preferably through real problems you come across, or via websites such as %%TODO ADD LINKS (AT LEAST 3)%%. To really understand something, just learning from others isn't enough - you ought to use it in practice for your own real problems.


# Book Structure
This book is split into multiple parts,

##### Main Chapters
The core path you should follow. Introduces the most important concepts, and links where to find more information about each of them. You should briefly check the Reference pages linked from the Chapters, but only enough to understand when you might need of them, and only worry about Extra pages if you truly need of them.
Follow the [[Chapters/Basics/Introduction - Setup/Read Order|Read Order]] for them.

##### Exercises
After learning about any sort of concepts, you have to use them yourself to truly understand how to use them and where they fit in real problems.
Solve them in the order they appear in the Main Chapters Read Order.

##### Projects
Larger projects you'll have to choose one of to start after reaching a certain point in the Book.
You can preview what it looks like by checking [[Projects/Basic/Introduction to Projects|Introduction to Projects]], but do not hurry.

##### Reference pages
A more detailed view into technical details about the concepts you'll use for the core Exercises. Do not worry about memorizing any of this, you can always check back when you actually need of something.
The [[Chapters/Reference/Reference Index|Reference Index]] lists all of them, and may be useful to review what you have already learned.

##### Extra pages
A deeper dive into certain aspects of Python and the ecosystem around it, which may be useful when you are trying to solve real problems beyond the scope of the Main Chapters. You can safely ignore them if this is your first introduction to Python.
The [[Extra/Extra Pages Index|Extra Pages Index]] lists them, and may be useful to check for common issues, look for information about third-party libraries, tools etc.
