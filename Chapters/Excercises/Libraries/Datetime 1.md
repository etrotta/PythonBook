### Exercise 1 - Birthdays

##### 1.1) Age
Given someone's birth date, calculate and display their current age in years and months.

##### 1.2) Next Birthday
Print when their next birthday will be, and how many years they'll turn. Use the following format:
```
(day of the week), (padded day) (month name) (short year)

Example for date `2021-01-07`, for someone born in 2000:
You will turn 21 in a Thursday, 07 January 21
```

### Exercise 2 - Time Zones

##### 2.1) Comparing dates in different timezones
Assume that an event will start at `2100-01-01T21:30:00-03:00` and end in `2100-01-02T12:15:00+09:00`. Calculate its duration in hours and minutes.

##### 2.2) Repeating Events
Assume that an event happens every week `Sunday at 9:30 AM JST` (JST = `+09:00`).

Convert that to your time zone and print when it will happen for the next four weeks.
