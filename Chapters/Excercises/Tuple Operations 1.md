Compared to the other types, tuples are fairly simple, and the main reasons you'd really use them over the others in practice is their simplicity or elegancy.

There aren't that operations to practice, but it's also important to remember that they can be used alongside other types.

### Exercise 1 - Tuples x Lists

Create and display a formatted string following the specification for each element in the list:

```py
champions = [
	('Yuumi', 'magical cat', 9),
	('Caitlyn', 'Sheriff of Piltover', 25),
	('Lord Colonel Major Centurion Kled', 'Cantankerous Cavaliers', 1000),
]

"""Expected output:
Yuumi, the Magical Cat, is 9 years old.
Caitlyn, the Sheriff Of Piltover, is 25 years old.
Lord Colonel Major Centurion Kled, the Cantankerous Cavaliers, is 1000 years old.
"""
```
