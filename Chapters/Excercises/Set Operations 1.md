### Introduction

This Challenge is optional, and even less directed than your average exercise in this book.

You're given a data set, some guiding questions, and have to explore the data to find the answers to the questions as well as come up with your own insights about it.

> After finishing it, you may want to come back and improve upon your answers once you learn how to use `for` loops.
> 
> In a similar vein, if you decide to explore Data Science in more detail, you may want to come back and try using data frames to solve it.

### Proposed Questions

- How many of your cards belong to each generation?
- How many of your cards come from each pack?
- Which pack do you have the most cards of?
- How many unique cards exist in total?

Try to come up with at least three other questions and find the answer to them yourself
