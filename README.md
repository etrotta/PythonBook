### Etrotta's Python Book

This is the GitHub repostiory for a Python book being written by etrotta
(Name not decided yet. Still in 'alpha' at best, read at your own risk if you somehow found this.)

### Instructions

- Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or your preferred text editor that supports Markdown files
- Copy this repository, by either:
    - [Create a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of this repository and [clone your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), so that you can keep track of your own notes and back them up in your own repository
    - Or download this repository as a Zip file, then extract it and open as an Obsidian Vault
- Open the `Chapters\Basics\Introduction - Setup\About this book.md` page, and start progressing through the Links at the end of each page until you reach the `Read Order`. Once you reach it, Pin it and refer back to it every so often.
- Write your own Notes to your Vault as you progress through the book, including things like (but not limited to)
    - External resources you found that were useful (be it articles, documentation, tutorials, websites, videos, StackOverflow answers, or even memes)
    - Do your own experiments to see how things work, and write down your result
    - Anything you want to remind your Future Self

(VVV Not yet implemented)
- After you finish the Basic chapters listed in the Read Order, you can move on to the Projects overview, pick one, and follow its own Read Order.
- After you complete a Project, you could pick another Project or consider this book complete and move on to your own personal projects

### Book Structure

This book is not linear. I don't know if you can even call it a "Book". It is definitely not meant to exist in the physical world as a paper book.

The recommended order in which you should progress through the pages is documented in the read order, but there is a lot of optional content ("Extra" pages) you can opt to read or to skip, which go deeper into specific topics.

After you finish the 'Basic' chapters, you should pick one of multiple proposed projects to dive deeper into whichever area interests you, and learn how to apply what you've learned to that area.

You may also learn some generic concepts we do not include in the Basic chapters applied to it, such as testing and dealing with exceptions, as the way you implement that can vary a lot between different domains.

The solutions to the Exercises will be made available in a separate repository at a later date, but I strongly recommend you spend at least a day trying to solve the problems yourself before you check them.

Remember to take breaks when you get stuck for too long.

### Notes on the current state
This is pretty much v0.0.1-Alpha

Currently the book currently ends after Basic chapters, with a few ideas for Projects but none implemented yet

I might change plans to include some unit testing & exception handling inside of the Basic chapters, but am afraid that readers will start losing motivation at around the current end of the basic chapters, so I'd rather go into projects they care more about ASAP.

If anything, I can make a 'neutral'-ish project that just covers testing, misc best practices like tooling (ruff, hatch), packaging (pyproject.toml and some of its common options), and sharing packages (pypi, pip install git+https, exes and why they're a bad idea)

There are a **lot** of planned pages missing, including pages mentioned in the basic chapters, and a worryingly large amount of redundant content (same information being present in two or more pages), but I figured I'd get some feedback before investing any more time into this.

I'll also probably significantly change most existing pages before I'm content with calling it a '1.0.0', maybe specially the Exercises - not to mention many pages not following the 'template' you would expect from other similar pages.


I'll probably also remove the 'author opnions' folder later, but eh, wrote it so leaving in for now

And lastly... the lack of a license is intentional. I'm not sure what I'll do with this book, if even anything at all, but I know I'm not accepting contributions right now - only feedback.
